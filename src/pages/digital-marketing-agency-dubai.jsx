          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "In 2025, UAE businesses should focus on Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok, and Facebook because they have a lot of active users. Instagram works well for picture-based campaigns and influencer collaborations. LinkedIn is great for B2B marketing. TikTok is growing quickly, which gives you a chance to reach younger people with creative content. Facebook is still a good way to contact a lot of different types of people. Pick the right platforms based on where your ideal clients hang out online."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Email marketing automation sends personalized communications depending on what users do and like. It helps in keeping customers. Automated emails, for instance, can suggest things based on what a consumer has bought in the past or remind them about carts they left behind. This constant, personalized communication keeps the brand in people's minds. It also motivates them to buy from you again without you having to do anything. Automation also gives businesses information on how customers behave, which helps them improve their strategy and provide customers with even more useful content."
